Rain works on mobile / PC / console vertexlit / forward / deferred renderer and dx9, dx11, openGL.
To use, simply move the prefab "Rain (EditorVersion)" (only) or "RainOptimized" (PC and mobile) to the scene.
Standard prefabs have an area of 10 by 10 meters. You can change the scale if necessary. As well, you can increase the amount of water droplets in the tab "emission-> Rate".
If necessary, you can change the distortion drops by setting the "distortion" shader "WaterDrop".
