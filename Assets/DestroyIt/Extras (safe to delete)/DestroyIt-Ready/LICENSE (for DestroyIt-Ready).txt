Extended Permissions from ModelShark Studio:

1) Permission is granted to include the DestructibleStub and TagItStub scripts in your Unity assets for commercial or non-commercial use.

2) Permission is also granted to modify the DestructibleStub and TagItStub scripts so long as they do not include other code from our DestroyIt products.

The purpose of this permission is to allow you to sell DestroyIt-Ready assets without needing to include DestroyIt code dependencies.

All other scripts and assets fall under the regular Unity Asset Store terms and conditions.
